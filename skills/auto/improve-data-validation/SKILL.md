description: Use when validating data formats and ensuring data integrity in processing tasks.

1. **Define Expected Formats**: Clearly document the expected formats for all data inputs, including types (e.g., string, integer, decimal) and structures (e.g., JSON schema).
2. **Implement Input Validation**: Before processing, validate all inputs against the defined formats. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
3. **Log Validation Errors**: Maintain a log of any validation errors encountered during processing, including the input that caused the error and a description of the issue.
4. **Use Type Annotations**: Ensure all public functions have type annotations for parameters and return values to clarify expected data types.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Create unit tests that cover edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure robustness against unexpected data formats.
