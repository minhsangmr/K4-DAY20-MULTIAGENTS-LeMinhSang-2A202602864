### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/app.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-01T03:04:05Z", "service": "payment-service", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "Charge failed order=991", "exception": "ValueError: invalid card number", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"payment-service": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR or CRITICAL (any capitalisation). Do not include WARN/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG entries.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after `<service>: ` on the first line of the entry.
- `exception` is the last line of the traceback attached to the entry, or `null` if the entry has no traceback.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

1. **Define Expected Formats**: Clearly document the expected formats for all data inputs, including types (e.g., string, integer, decimal) and structures (e.g., JSON schema).
2. **Implement Input Validation**: Before processing, validate all inputs against the defined formats. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
3. **Log Validation Errors**: Maintain a log of any validation errors encountered during processing, including the input that caused the error and a description of the issue.
4. **Use Type Annotations**: Ensure all public functions have type annotations for parameters and return values to clarify expected data types.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Create unit tests that cover edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure robustness against unexpected data formats.

1. **Write Regression Tests**: For every bug fix, create a regression test that replicates the issue to ensure it does not reoccur in the future.
2. **Organize Tests Logically**: Structure tests in a clear hierarchy, grouping related tests together and naming them descriptively to indicate their purpose.
3. **Use Assertions Effectively**: Utilize assertions to check for expected outcomes, ensuring that tests fail when the actual output does not match the expected output.
4. **Run Tests Regularly**: Integrate automated testing into the development workflow, running tests after every significant change to catch issues early.
5. **Document Test Cases**: Provide clear documentation for each test case, explaining its purpose, expected inputs, and expected outputs.

# app.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    <timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>

- `timestamp` is ISO-8601 with a UTC offset (`+07:00`, `-05:00` or `Z`).
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- An entry can be followed by extra lines (for example a Python traceback). Those lines belong to the entry above them.
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.
